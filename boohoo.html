    <h2>01 — Concept & Goals</h2>
    <p>
      This project began with the idea of using jumpscare and loud noises to create and intense experience. 
      I wanted players to rely on their flashlight to stun ghosts without getting touched. 
      My goal was to balance fear, timing, and exploration while keeping gameplay readable and simple.

    <h2>02 — Movement Prototype</h2>
    <p>Movements were tested out with keyboard controls as well as arrow key.
        Enemies were made sure to select target from a certain distance and follows
        the player until they our out of range.

    <h2>03 — Enemies + Traps</h2>
    <p>
        Zombies and Ghosts follow a strict steer towards target to wonder mechanism.
        FOV is used to detect players. Arrows fly from top to bottom in random x coordinate.
        Each type of enemy does significant damage to the player, increasing the level of difficulty.

  <h2>04 — Flashlight System + Jumpscare</h2>
  <p>
    The flashlight uses a similar FOV type mechanism to create a cone shaped light beam that
    would stun enemies when shinet at the target. SPACE BAR turns on the flashlight on and off.
    Turning the flashlight on lowers the battery and shortens duration. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Jumpscare is a sudden reaction that swtiches on when user is in contact with the player.
    A scary image as well as loud screaming noise is intended to frighten user

    <h2>05 — Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of game loops, state machines, 
      collision detection, and responsive UI design. 
      I also learned the importance of testing mechanic readability early in development.
