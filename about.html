        <p class="about-description">
            I am a game developer / designer, completing my science degree at Simon Fraser University.
            I focus on taking small ideas and expanding them to be something admirable. 
            Seeing these journeys and progress is what makes this gaming industry enjoyable 
            for me. I hope to become part of 
            My key strength of programs consist of Java, Javscript, Processing and Python.

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy designing systems that feel fair but challenging. When I build
          a game, I start from core mechanics: how it moves, how enemies react,
          and how players read danger. Once the logic feels solid, I layer in
          visuals, sound, and atmosphere to finish the experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work often combines technical problem-solving with visual design.
          I use code to drive behaviours like collision, state machines, and
          field-of-view detection, while also paying attention to layout,
          typography, and how information is presented to the player.

        <div class="values-card">
          <h3>Experiment First</h3>
          <p>
            I prototype quickly using simple visuals, then focus on how it
            feels to move, jump, dodge, and react before further polishing.

        <div class="values-card">
          <h3>Player-Centered</h3>
          <p>
            I think about how players will learn the game: what they see first,
            what might be their next move, and how they understand feedback like damage,
            stun, or danger.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="values-card">
          <h3>Always Iterating</h3>
          <p>
            I refine by testing, breaking things, and adjusting codes.
            Small tweaks to speed, timing, or hitboxes can completely change
            the quality of the game.
